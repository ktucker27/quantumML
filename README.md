# quantumML
A collection of packages applying machine learning to problems in quantum mechanics

## Hamiltonian Learning
Training data can be simulated using data_gen.py in the sdes package (see notebooks/test_data_gen.ipynb for examples). Models can be trained and evaluated using train.py in the models package. See command line help description for details

## NQS Package
Start with the nqs_run.m script, modifying the package path and save file path as necessary
